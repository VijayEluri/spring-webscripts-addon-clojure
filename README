Clojure script processor for Spring Surf

Spring Surf is a view composition framework for Spring MVC that plugs into your existing Spring applications.
It provides a scriptable and content-centric approach to building web applications.

This extension provides a Clojure script processor that makes it possible to implement Clojure controllers
for your Spring Surf web scripts.

Your clojure controller should yield a map of values you want to pass to the view rendition. Have a look at
the tests provided here to have an idea about how to use this extension.
